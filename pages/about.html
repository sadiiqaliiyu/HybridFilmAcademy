                        <h1>Hybrid Film Academy</h1>
                        <p>The Academy is the result of a simple thought to bring the art and 
                            craft of filmmaking to passionate mind on the belief that a top
                            quality education in filmmaking should be accessible to anyone

                        Hybrid Film Academy unlike other film and media institute is 
                        inspired by the need to be the bridge between aspiring filmmaking
                        enthusiast and passion driven actors who really wnat to be part of the 
                        movie industry by all means possible but lacks the capacity and professional 
                        know-how and top notch filmmaking practitioner who have zero tolerance
                        unprofessionalism.

                        a part of their coursework. Students write, produce, direct, and edit thier 
                        very own unique movies while additionally filling in as crew members on their
                        colleagues' movies to gain extensive experience on-set.

                        Currently, we hold our training programs in FCT-Abuja the Nation's capital and 
                        Lagos all in Nigeria. We are working tirelessly to spread tentacles to more
                        states and countries for easy access to aspiring film-makers who would love
                        to learn.

                    <p class='para'>To support our philosophy and our innovative curriculum, Hybrid 
                        Film Academy (HYFA) maintains an unparalleled faculty and one

                    <p class='para'>
                        The Film Academy's many programs in visual and performing arts
                        do not require previous experience, however, they challenge
                        students to push their creative abilities to the maximum.
                    </p>

                    <p class='para'>We believe that the most effective way for our students can 
                        master thier chosen craft is to immediately start creating 
                        thier own work in a hands-on intensive working environment.
                        Towards this end, all students begin practicisng thier craft during
                        the first week of all our programs.

                            Our course are taught through a balance of classroom instruction, hands-on
                            workshop, and immediate experience. The approach is holistic, ensuring
                            that students understand and have experience in all aspects of the subjects they
                            are studying. This gives them flexibility, as they become professionals.
                            The experience they gain in the many collaborative roles that are required to
                            produce good work will be immeasurable value to them as directors, actors, writers,
                            producers, editors, Cinematographers, or whichever path they can be.
